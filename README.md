# CREA CO2 Tracker
The EU CO2 Emission Tracker is an initiative by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) to produce timely and publicly available data on Europe’s CO2 emissions. By monitoring and analyzing emissions across the power sector, transport, industry, and buildings, the CO2 Tracker aims to help decision-makers, researchers, and the wider society understand the latest trends and respond effectively to climate challenges.


The project welcomes collaboration with partners—be they government bodies, think tanks, civil society organizations, or academic institutions.

Live charts are available on [CREA's website](https://energyandcleanair.org/product/eu-co2-emission-tracker/).
